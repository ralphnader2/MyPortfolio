                    <h1>About Me</h1>
                    <p>Hi, my name is Ralph and I was born and raised in a small town called Winters. Winters is located 30 minutes west of Sacramento, California.
                    I gratuated from California State University of Sacramento with a bachelor's degree of computer engineering.</p>
                    <p>I like to travel and play golf. I also, like to build robots and like to program. I also love to play video games and I want
                    to make a mobile game one day. I am also a casino lover, so yes I do gamble. I also want to make my own slot machine someday, but that
                    will be later in the future.
                    </p>
                    <p>My Skills, Projects and Contact information are listed on different pages if you want to know more about me</p>
